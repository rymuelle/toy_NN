# toy_NN
This is just a simple neural network written in python for (self)educational purposes.
There is plenty of room for improvement, but it shows off the core features of a neural net in a simple class, can it could even be modified to do something useful if desired!

As is, the one and only file "toy_NN.py", when run, will create a fake dataset of 4 vectors of length 5, find the optimal training rate, and train the neural net to identify those vectors.
